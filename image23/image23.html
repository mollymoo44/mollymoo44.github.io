		<h3>Lundy Island is a island off the shore of Westward Ho! It has a small area of about<br>1,100 acres but dispite the space restrictions manages to comfortably harbour a small village<br>and a church. Lundy Island's church stands just outside the village and built by the very first<br>inhabitant of the island makes it one of the oldest standing structures on the island. The small<br>village on Lundy has a decent sized shop with everyday items as well as souvenirs for visitors, it<br>also has many houses and a pub that serves all kinds of drinks foods and not to mention its<br>7.00 pound chips. There is a ferry going from Bideford to the island that allows people to have a<br>scenic boat ride and spend a day exploring the island and viewing its interesting ecosystem.<br>Exciting animals can often be seen on the island such as puffins and sharks making it the ideal<br>place for birdwatchers and animal enthusiasts alike.</h3>
